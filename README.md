#Newtonian Gravity Simulations

Simulations are carried out using the Runge-Kutta Fourth Order method to estimate the position of planets with n-bodies acting on them. 

First simulation is the solar system. For stable orbit of the moon, dt needs to around 1hr. 

Second is sandbox simulation that spawns suns of varying massses and velocities. Simple collison mechanics are used. If the radia overlap, masses are combined and momentum is conserved for one of the colliders.
